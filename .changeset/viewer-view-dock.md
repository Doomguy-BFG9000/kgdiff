Changes only is now a scope that combines with any mode instead of a fourth mode: `mode` is `overlay | swipe | replay` and the new `scope` (`all | changes`) shows only the changes, in overlay, swipe or replay alike. `mode="changes"` still works (overlay + `scope="changes"`), as do old `#kgdiff=…;mode:changes` links; `kgdiff-mode` reports `{ mode, scope }`. The CLI gains `--scope` (`--mode changes` keeps working).

The canvas loses its header bar: the title floats top left, the actions top right, and the modes, the Changes only toggle with its context hops, and replay's transport live in one dock at the bottom. The diffstat pills (the sidebar's filter chips show the same counts) and the second fit button are gone, the chips wear the legend's swatches, the legend starts collapsed and the minimap appears only while part of the graph is out of view. Unchanged node labels use the muted text color, so the changes stand out.
